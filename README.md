# Four-level-flicker-mitigation-for-OCC

## Background
Optical camera communication (OCC) is an optical wireless communication technique that uses a camera as the receiver and visible light source, such as light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires, as the transmitters. 

In most of the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, the rolling shutter is used to enable the pixel to expose row by row or column by column. Therefore, when the LED is modulated much faster than the frame rate, each image can capture multiple data and significantly improve the data rate. In the OCC system, one important issue is flicker â€” the fast blinking of a light source (if signals are below 200 Hz). Flicker may increase the chance of migraines, headaches, and even repetitive behavior among persons with autism. Therefore, mitigation schemes must be employed to achieve flicker-mitigation transmission in the practical OCC system.
